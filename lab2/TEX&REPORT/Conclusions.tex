\section*{Conclusions}

On my opinion this laboratory work was easier than previous, I've learned a lot of things as how to create a list box and of course the most interesting thing that I've learned how to work with resources. Also I've learned how to set a window menu and add menu items to it. I think that the most difficult task of this lab was the task from bonus point , to create a scrollbar that will scroll the Window content.
